# **Abstract** | *Who am I?*

I'm Marshall, I'm a Software Engineer and Reverse Engineer in the making. I specialize in C, C++, x86 and x64 ASM, and python.
I started learning programming when I was around 5-6 years old on an old Mac Mini and was immediately fascinated by how such a tiny device could do thousands of operations per second.
And from there, curiosity did the rest of the work. I had a ton of questions on how computers worked on a hardware level, as well as on a software level.

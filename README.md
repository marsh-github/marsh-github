# **Background**
I'm **Marshall**, I'm a **Software Engineer** and **Reverse Engineer** in the making. I specialize in **C, C++, x86 and x64 ASM, and Lua.**
I started learning programming when I was around 5-6 years old on an old Mac Mini and was immediately fascinated by how such a tiny device could do thousands of operations per second.
And from there, curiosity did the rest of the work. I had a ton of questions on how computers worked on a hardware level, as well as on a software level.

# **What am I currently working on?**
- Several projects with my friends (code obfuscators, code **DE**-obfuscators, compilers, micro-kernels, *flux capacitors, cure to cancer*..)
- Emulators (specifically QEMU based ones, and I *do occasionally* dable in building software-based emulation *frameworks*)
- Instrumentation Tooling (IDA scripts, small projects/helpers *here* and *there*)
- Vulnerability discovery, specifically in the *Windows Kernel* with things like ***RCE***

# **What are my interests?**
- If it wasn't *immediately* obvious, low-level systems engineering and kernel development
- Cryptography & Math
- Cooking/Culinary Arts
- Design (I really enjoy UI design)
- Literature & Philosophy
